A presentation-style PDF may have large images that can be optimized, but aggressive compression can make charts, product photos, or screenshots harder to read.",
              "The goal is not simply to make the smallest possible file. The goal is to make a file that fits the email limit while still serving the document purpose.

If the file will be forwarded several times, leaving extra margin also helps because some systems add message overhead.",

This is risky for contracts, receipts, IDs, certificates, reports, and forms where small text, seals, stamps, tables, or signatures matter.",

Under the hood every tool does roughly the same two steps: it reads the text out of the PDF, then sends that text plus your question to a large language model.",

It is built specifically around working with one document at a time.",

It can discuss an uploaded file, but reliable file handling generally sits behind a paid plan or tighter free limits, it is not designed solely around a single document, and it does not always point you to the exact passage an answer came from. ChatPDF is a dedicated chat-with-PDF product whose free tier typically caps the number of pages and the file size, with paid tiers to lift those limits. All three can answer questions about a PDF; they make different tradeoffs getting there.",

The original file is not uploaded to a DockDocs server.",
