A short report can stay small, while a scanned contract or image-heavy deck can exceed common email limits very quickly. The file size does not always match the page count, because a single high-resolution scan can use more space than many pages of clean text.",

A scanned PDF depends more on image quality, color depth, and page resolution. A presentation-style PDF may have large images that can be optimized, but aggressive compression can make charts, product photos, or screenshots harder to read.",
              "The goal is not simply to make the smallest possible file. The goal is to make a file that fits the email limit while still serving the document purpose. Contracts, invoices, applications, school forms, and government documents need different tradeoffs from casual image packets or internal drafts.",

If your company email limit is 25 MB but a client portal accepts only 10 MB, aim for the smaller limit. If the file will be forwarded several times, leaving extra margin also helps because some systems add message overhead.",

If the first compressed result is still too large, it is often better to adjust the workflow, remove unnecessary pages, or split the document instead of pushing compression harder.",
              "Another mistake is sending the compressed file without opening it. A PDF may meet the file-size target but lose the detail that makes it useful. This is risky for contracts, receipts, IDs, certificates, reports, and forms where small text, seals, stamps, tables, or signatures matter.",
              "A third mistake is treating all PDFs the same. A text report, a scan packet, and an image-heavy brochure need different expectations. Compression should preserve the purpose of the document, not only satisfy a number in the file properties panel.",
              "For email, the safest practice is to keep the recipient's task in mind. If they need to read and approve the file, quality matters more than the smallest size. If they only need a quick archive copy, stronger compression may be acceptable.",
              "Teams can also standardize naming and review rules. A shared habit such as compress, open, verify, rename, and send keeps the workflow consistent across clients, departments, and repeated monthly document handoffs.",

              "The biggest mistake is converting every image in a folder without reviewing it first. Duplicate pages, blurry retakes, unrelated screenshots, and accidental photos make the final PDF harder to trust. A quick cleanup before upload usually saves more time than fixing the PDF afterward.",
              "Another common issue is ignoring page orientation. One sideways page can interrupt the whole document, especially when the PDF is being submitted to a school, client, accountant, or official portal. Rotate images before export or check the final PDF carefully after conversion.",
              "The third mistake is creating a PDF that is visually correct but too large to use. Image-based PDFs can grow quickly. After export, check file size and decide whether compression is needed before email, upload, or archive.",
